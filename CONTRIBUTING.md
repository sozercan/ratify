# Contributing to Ratify

Welcome! We are very happy to accept community contributions to Ratify, whether those are [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), [Plugins](#plugins), [Feature Suggestions](#feature-suggestions) or [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)! Please note that by participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as well as the terms of the [CLA](#cla).

## Getting Started

* If you don't already have it, you will need [go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.16+ installed locally to build the project.
* You can work on Ratify using any platform using any editor, but you may find it quickest to get started using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
* Fork this repo (see [this forking guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information).
* Checkout the repo locally with `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/ratify.git`.
* Build the Ratify CLI with `go build -o ./bin/ratify ./cmd/ratify` or if on Mac/Linux/WSL `make build-cli`.

## Developing

### Components

The Ratify project is composed of the following main components:

* **Ratify CLI** (`cmd/ratify`): the `ratify` CLI executable.
* **Config** (`config`): an example configuration file for `ratify`.
* **Deploy** (`deploy`): the deployment files for using ratify in a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Ratify Internals** (`pkg`): the internal modules containing the majority of the Ratify code.
* **Plugins** (`plugins`): the referrer store and verifier plugins for the Ratify Framework.

### Running the tests

* You can use the following command to run the full Ratify test suite:
  * `go test -v ./cmd/ratify` on Windows
  * `make test` on Mac/Linux/WSL

### Running the Ratify CLI

* Once built run Ratify from the bin directory `./bin/ratify` for a list of the available commands.
* For any command the `--help` argument can be passed for more information and a list of possible arguments.

### Debugging Ratify with VS Code

Ratify can run through cli command or run as a http server. Create a [launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) file in the .vscode directory, then hit F5 to debug. Note the first debug session may take a few minutes to load, subsequent session will be much faster.

Sample json for cli:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
      "name": "Debug Ratify cli ",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/ratify",
      "args": ["verify", "-s", "ratify.azurecr.io/testimage@sha256:9515b691095051d68b4409a30c4819c98bd6f4355d5993a7487687cdc6d47cc3"]
    }]
}
```

Sample launch json for http server:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
      "name": "Debug Ratify ",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "debug",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/ratify",
      "args": ["serve", "--http", ":6001", "-c", "/home/azureuser/.ratify/config.json"]
    }]
}
```

Sample curl request to invoke Ratify endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6001/ratify/gatekeeper/v1/verify -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"apiVersion":"externaldata.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1","kind":"ProviderRequest","request":{"keys":["localhost:5000/net-monitor:v1"]}}'
```

### Test local changes in the k8s cluster scenario

There are some changes that should be validated in a cluster scenario.
Follow the steps below to build and deploy a Ratify image with your private changes:

#### build an image with your local changes

```bash
docker build -f httpserver/Dockerfile -t yourregistry/deislabs/ratify:yourtag .
```

#### [Authenticate](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#usage) with your registry,  and push the newly built image

```bash
docker push yourregistry/deislabs/ratify:yourtag
```

#### Update [values.yaml](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/blob/main/charts/ratify/values.yaml) to pull from your registry, when reusing image tag, setting pull policy to "Always" ensures we are pull the new changes

```json
image:
  repository: yourregistry/deislabs/ratify
  tag: yourtag
  pullPolicy: Always
```

### Deploy from local helm chart

Deploy using one of the following deployments.
Note: Ratify upgraded Gatekeeper to 3.11.0, server auth is required to be enabled.

**Option 1**
Client auth disabled and server auth enabled using self signed certificate

```bash
helm install ratify ./charts/ratify --atomic
```

**Option 2**
Client auth disabled and server auth enabled using your own certificate

Deploy using a certificate

```bash
helm install ratify ./charts/ratify \
    --set provider.tls.cabundle="$(cat certs/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n\r')" \
    --set provider.tls.key="$(cat certs/tls.key)" \
    --set provider.tls.crt="$(cat certs/tls.crt)" \
    --atomic
```

**Option 3**
Client / Server auth enabled (mTLS)  

>Note: Ratify and Gatekeeper must be installed in the same namespace which allows Ratify access to Gatekeepers CA certificate. The Ratify certificate must have a CN and subjectAltName name which matches the namespace of Gatekeeper and Ratify. For example, if installed to the namespace 'gatekeeper-system', the CN and subjectAltName should be 'ratify.gatekeeper-system'*

```bash
helm install ratify ./charts/ratify \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system \
    --set provider.tls.cabundle="$(cat certs/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n\r')" \
    --set provider.tls.key="$(cat certs/tls.key)" \
    --set provider.tls.crt="$(cat certs/tls.crt)" \
    --atomic
```

## Pull Requests

If you'd like to start contributing to Ratify, you can search for issues tagged as "good first issue" [here](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/labels/good%20first%20issue).

### Plugins

If you'd like to contribute to the collection of plugins:

#### Referrer Store

* A referrer store should implement the `ReferrerStore` interface (`pkg/referrerstore/api.go`).
* This should provide a mechanism to list referrers, and retrieve manifests and blob content.
* A sample referrer store is provided at `plugins/reffererstore/sample/sample.go`.

#### Verifier

* A verifier should implement the `ReferenceVerifier` interface (`pkg/verifier/api.go`).
* This should provide a mechanism to perform verification against blobs and manifests from a referrer store.
* A sample verifier is provided at `plugins/verifier/sample/sample.go`.

## Feature Suggestions

* Please first search [Open Ratify Issues](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/issues) before opening an issue to check whether your feature has already been suggested. If it has, feel free to add your own comments to the existing issue.
* Ensure you have included a "What?" - what your feature entails, being as specific as possible, and giving mocked-up syntax examples where possible.
* Ensure you have included a "Why?" - what the benefit of including this feature will be.

## Bug Reports

* Please first search [Open Ratify Issues](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/issues) before opening an issue, to see if it has already been reported.
* Try to be as specific as possible, including the version of the Ratify CLI used to reproduce the issue, and any example arguments needed to reproduce it.

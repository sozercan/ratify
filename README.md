# Ratify

Is a verification engine as a binary executable and on Kubernetes which enables verification of artifact security metadata and admits for deployment only those that comply with policies you create.

**WARNING:** This is not considered production-grade code
by its developers, nor is it "supported" software.

## Quick Start

Try out ratify in Kubernetes through Gatekeeper as the admission controller.
For quick start steps compatible with the last released version of Ratify, follow steps [here](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/blob/1.0.0-rc.1/README.md#quick-start).

Prerequisites:
- Kubernetes v1.20 or higher
- OPA Gatekeeper v3.10 or higher

Setup Gatekeeper with [external data](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/externaldata)

```bash
helm repo add gatekeeper https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts

helm install gatekeeper/gatekeeper  \
    --name-template=gatekeeper \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system --create-namespace \
    --set enableExternalData=true \
    --set validatingWebhookTimeoutSeconds=5 \
    --set mutatingWebhookTimeoutSeconds=2
```

NOTE: `validatingWebhookTimeoutSeconds` and `mutationWebhookTimeoutSeconds` increased from 3 to 5 and 1 to 2 respectively, so all Ratify operations complete in complex scenarios. See [discussion here](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/issues/269) to remove this requirement. Kubernetes v1.20 or higher is REQUIRED to increase timeout. Timeout is configurable in helm chart under `provider.timeout` section.   

- Deploy ratify on gatekeeper in the default namespace.

Note: if the crt/key/cabundle are NOT set under `provider.tls` in values.yaml, helm would generate a CA certificate and server key/certificate for you.

```bash
helm repo add ratify https://deislabs.github.io/ratify
# download the notary verification certificate
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deislabs/ratify/main/test/testdata/notary.crt
helm install ratify \
    ratify/ratify --atomic \
    --namespace gatekeeper-system \
    --set-file notaryCert=./notary.crt
```

- Deploy a `demo` constraint.
```
kubectl apply -f https://deislabs.github.io/ratify/library/default/template.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://deislabs.github.io/ratify/library/default/samples/constraint.yaml
```

Once the installation is completed, you can test the deployment of an image that is signed using Notary V2 solution.

- This will successfully create the pod `demo`

```bash
kubectl run demo --image=wabbitnetworks.azurecr.io/test/notary-image:signed
kubectl get pods demo
```

Optionally you can see the output of the pod logs via: `kubectl logs demo`

- Now deploy an unsigned image

```bash
kubectl run demo1 --image=wabbitnetworks.azurecr.io/test/notary-image:unsigned
```

You will see a deny message from Gatekeeper denying the request to create it as the image doesn't have any signatures.

```bash
Error from server (Forbidden): admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [ratify-constraint] Subject failed verification: wabbitnetworks.azurecr.io/test/net-monitor:unsigned
```

You just validated the container images in your k8s cluster!

- Uninstall Ratify

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://deislabs.github.io/ratify/library/default/template.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://deislabs.github.io/ratify/library/default/samples/constraint.yaml
helm delete ratify
```

### Notes

If the image reference provided resolves to an OCI Index or a Docker Manifest List, validation will occur ONLY at the index or manifest list level. Ratify currently does NOT support image validation based on automatic platform selection. For more information, [see this issue](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/issues/101).

## Documents

The [docs](docs/README.md) folder contains the beginnings of a formal
specification for the Reference Artifact Verification framework and its plugin model.
